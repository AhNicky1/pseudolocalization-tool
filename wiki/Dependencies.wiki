#summary Dependencies for building pseudolocalization-tool
#labels Phase-Implementation,Featured

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/htmlparser/ HtmlParser] is required for normal operation, and [http://www.junit.org/ JUnit] is required for the tests.

Compatible versions of both are provided in svn at [http://pseudolocalization-tool.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lib/ trunk/lib] or you can supply your own versions.

These are also packaged up in a `pseudolocalization-*-deps.jar` for convenience.
